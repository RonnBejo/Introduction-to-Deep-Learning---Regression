# 🧠 Regression Example – Deep Learning Assignment

This repository contains my **first assignment** for the course **Autonomy Technologies** at **FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg**, as part of the subject **Introduction to Deep Learning**.

The assignment explores the implementation of a **regression task using neural networks**, conducted through a Jupyter Notebook. It serves as an introductory exercise to understand basic deep learning workflows, model architecture, and training evaluation.
